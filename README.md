## What's this client?

This is an updated version of AQLite meant to keep it working post the new AQW changes.
I'm not sure why you would use this as opposed to the official [Artix Game launcher](https://www.artix.com/downloads/artixlauncher/), but nevertheless, it works.
The AQLite Settings Menu has been removed from view, since pretty much all the options are in the new game.swf anyway.
*Note* : I haven't touched any of the assets in the .fla file. Credit goes to 133spider and relevant authorities.

Battle On :)
